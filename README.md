# DynamicWebsiteProject

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- PHP
- MySQL
- A web server like Apache
- XAMPP or UWAMP

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. If using XAMPP:
- Start Apache and MySQL from the XAMPP control panel.
- You may need to remove the root password for MySQL, as XAMPP does not set a root password by default.

4. If using UWAMP:
- Start the server and MySQL.
- Ensure you set the root password as specified in your project configuration.

### Configuration

- Update the database connection settings in your PHP scripts:
- For XAMPP users, ensure the root password is removed in your database connection settings.
- For UWAMP users, use the root password that you have set up.
